Spain, the United Kingdom and the European Union have reached a "historic" agreement on Gibraltar after more than four years of negotiations. This Tuesday, the foreign ministers of Spain and the UK, José Manuel Albares and David Lammy, traveled to Brussels to meet with Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, responsible for the negotiations. The meeting was also joined by the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo. From this meeting, a "definitive political agreement" has emerged that sets the "foundations for the fundamental aspects of the future agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom regarding Gibraltar," according to the statement. "The fence will disappear, the last wall of continental Europe," Albares rejoiced, describing the agreement as a "historic agreement" that they have signed "thinking of the citizens."
